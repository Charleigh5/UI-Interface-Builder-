# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the AI Wireframe Designer application for mobile devices by implementing a full-screen canvas experience with a dockable toolbar. The current desktop-oriented layout needs to be adapted to provide an optimal mobile user experience while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want a full-screen canvas experience, so that I can maximize my drawing area and have an immersive wireframing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is accessed on a mobile device THEN the canvas SHALL occupy the full viewport without any fixed sidebars
2. WHEN in mobile mode THEN the canvas SHALL extend to all screen edges with no visible margins or padding
3. WHEN the user interacts with the canvas THEN all drawing and selection tools SHALL function identically to desktop mode
4. WHEN the viewport width is below 768px THEN the application SHALL automatically switch to mobile layout mode

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want a dockable toolbar that can be shown or hidden, so that I can access all tools without permanently reducing my canvas space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in mobile mode THEN the toolbar SHALL be hidden by default to maximize canvas space
2. WHEN the user taps a designated area or button THEN the toolbar SHALL slide in from the bottom of the screen
3. WHEN the toolbar is visible THEN it SHALL overlay the canvas without reducing the canvas size
4. WHEN the user taps outside the toolbar or a close button THEN the toolbar SHALL slide out and hide
5. WHEN the toolbar is docked THEN it SHALL remain accessible via swipe gestures or tap interactions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the toolbar to be touch-optimized, so that I can easily select tools and access features with my fingers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the toolbar is displayed on mobile THEN all tool buttons SHALL be at least 44px in height for touch accessibility
2. WHEN tools are displayed THEN they SHALL have adequate spacing between them to prevent accidental taps
3. WHEN the toolbar is in collapsed mode THEN it SHALL show only essential tools with clear, large icons
4. WHEN the user needs access to secondary features THEN they SHALL be accessible through expandable sections or secondary panels

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the properties panel and library to be accessible without interfering with my canvas work, so that I can modify components and access library items efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in mobile mode THEN the right sidebar SHALL be converted to a modal or bottom sheet interface
2. WHEN a component is selected THEN the properties panel SHALL be accessible via a floating action button or toolbar option
3. WHEN the user needs to access the component library THEN it SHALL open as a full-screen modal or slide-up panel
4. WHEN using the properties panel or library THEN the user SHALL be able to dismiss them with a clear close action

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want responsive touch interactions for canvas operations, so that I can draw, select, move, and resize components naturally with touch gestures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user performs touch gestures THEN pan, zoom, and selection operations SHALL work smoothly without conflicts
2. WHEN selecting components THEN touch targets SHALL be appropriately sized for finger interaction
3. WHEN resizing components THEN resize handles SHALL be large enough for precise touch manipulation
4. WHEN drawing with the pen tool THEN the drawing SHALL be responsive and accurate to touch input
5. WHEN using multi-touch gestures THEN pinch-to-zoom and two-finger pan SHALL work intuitively

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user switching between devices, I want the application to maintain consistent functionality across desktop and mobile, so that my workflow is not disrupted by device changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching from desktop to mobile THEN all existing components and canvas state SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN using mobile mode THEN all desktop features SHALL remain accessible through the mobile interface
3. WHEN returning to desktop mode THEN the layout SHALL revert to the standard desktop interface
4. WHEN using keyboard shortcuts on mobile devices with keyboards THEN they SHALL continue to function as expected
