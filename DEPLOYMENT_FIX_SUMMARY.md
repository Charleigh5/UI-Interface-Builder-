# Deployment Fix Summary

## 🐛 Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Context Hook Outside Provider

**Problem:** The `App` component was using `useContext(AppContext)` but was being rendered inside the `AppProvider` in `index.tsx`. This caused the context to be undefined, resulting in a blank navy blue screen.

**Fix:**

- Created an `AppContent` component that uses the context
- Made `App` a wrapper component that renders `AppContent`
- This ensures the context is properly available to all components

**Files Modified:**

- `App.tsx`

### Issue 2: Import Map Conflict

**Problem:** The `index.html` had an `importmap` trying to load React from a CDN (`aistudiocdn.com`), but Vite was already bundling React into the JavaScript file. This caused a module loading conflict.

**Fix:**

- Removed the conflicting `importmap` from `index.html`
- Now Vite properly bundles all dependencies including React

**Files Modified:**

- `index.html`

### Issue 3: Incomplete Toolbar Component

**Problem:** The `Toolbar.tsx` file was missing closing tags, causing build failures.

**Fix:**

- Added proper closing tags for the component structure
- Fixed the button closing tag syntax

**Files Modified:**

- `components/Toolbar.tsx`

## ✅ Verification Steps Completed

1. **Build Test:** `npm run build` - ✅ Success
2. **Code Review:** Checked all entry points - ✅ No errors
3. **Deployment:** `vercel --prod` - ✅ Success

### Issue 4: React Import Order

**Problem:** The `performanceMonitor.ts` file had the React import at the bottom of the file instead of the top, which could cause module loading issues.

**Fix:**

- Moved React import to the top of the file
- Removed duplicate import statement

**Files Modified:**

- `utils/performanceMonitor.ts`
